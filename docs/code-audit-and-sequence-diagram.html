	<h1>Neon Wallet Code Audit and Diagrams</h1>
	On August 6th, an independent code audit was done of neon-wallet and neon-wallet-db version 0.0.3 to look for security issues. The code auditor reported that
	there are a few minor cosmetic issues, but no security issues.
	<p>The wallet should be safe to use from a security standpoint.
	<h1>The Review</h1>
	<p>What did the code reviewer look for specifically?
	<p>
		1) They wanted to see how the private key was being stored and how it was used, to make sure the private key remained on the user's computer.<br> They
		found that the private key always remains on the user's computer, and is only used to sign transactions. These signed transactions are what leaves the user's
		computer and are sent drectly to the blockchain.
	<p>
		2) They wanted to see what back ends were being used and how, to see if there were any potential vulnerabilities. <br> The neon wallet does use an
		intermediary database (called neo-wallet-db on github) to cache some of the display data, but it's read-only. All transactions that modify data (Claiming
		Coins, and Sending Assets) go directly to the NEO blockchain.
	<p>Since all data modification is done by going directly to the blockchain, and only display data comes from the neo-wallet-db the wallet should be safe to
		use. The code can't be updated in neon-wallet withount the user pulling a new version.
	<h2>The neon-wallet-db database</h2>
	<p>What specifically comes from the neo-wallet-db? Your available GAS, available NEO, and your transaction history for your public address. This data isn't
		available via the NEO API yet, so they have an intermediate server that collects the data from the blockchain.
	<h1>Diagrams></h1>
	<p>The code reviewer also made three diagrams to illustrate how the program works:
	<p>
		1) an <a href="diagrams/arch.html">Architecture Diagram</a>, showing that all user initiated transactions (Claim All Gas, Send Asset) go to the Neo
		Blockchain, and only display data (Get Available Gas, Get Balance, Get Transaction History, Get Block Height) comes from the neo-wallet-db
	<p>
		2) a <a href="diagrams/seq.html">Sequence Diagram</a> showing how the Neon Wallet, Neon Wallet DB, and NEO Blockchain interact: The Private Key is only stored
		in the Neon Wallet, and only used to Sign Transactions.
	<p>
		3) an <a href="diagrams/erd.html">Entity Relationship Diagram</a> that shows how all the components of the neon wallet interact with eachother.
